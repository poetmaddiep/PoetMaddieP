      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m Maddie P., a performance poet, writing workshop host, and English major devoted to language as a tool for healing and resistance. I create spaces where vulnerability becomes power, and poetry becomes the bridge between the personal and political.</p>

      <p>As Houston’s first Black female Youth Poet Laureate, I’ve brought poetry into classrooms, community centers, and stages across the country. My work has been published in The New York Times and amplified through TEDx, where I explored race, equity, and inherited violence. Every poem I write is a conversation—with grief, with joy, with survival.</p>

      <p>Whether through workshops, live performances, or digital storytelling, I aim to remind people they are not alone—and that their words matter.</p>

      <p><strong>Values:</strong> Creativity, compassion, curiosity, intimacy, growth, and freedom.</p>
