    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Maddie P, a Houston-based performance poet and creative educator. I write with the intent to speak difficult truths and hold space for transformation. My work often explores mental health, identity, grief, and the quiet joys of survival.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the former Houston Youth Poet Laureate, I’ve performed for audiences big and small—on TEDx stages, in classrooms, and at local community events. My poem "To Be a Black Girl" was published in The New York Times and continues to resonate with readers and listeners alike.
