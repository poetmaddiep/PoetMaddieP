      <h3>Workshops</h3>
      <p>I offer writing workshops tailored to different age groups and experience levels. Each session is grounded in community-building, craft, and empowerment—participants walk away with new tools and new confidence in their voice.</p>

      <h3>Featured Performances</h3>
      <p>As a performance poet, I deliver emotionally resonant readings that combine lyricism, activism, and presence. Whether you’re organizing a festival, rally, or private event, I bring the words—and the fire—to every mic.</p>

      <h3>Guest Judging & Readings</h3>
      <p>I’m available to serve as a guest judge for youth and adult poetry competitions, as well as a featured reader or panelist for literary events. I’m especially passionate about centering marginalized voices and fostering equity in literary spaces.</p>
