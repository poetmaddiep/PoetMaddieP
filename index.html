    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Maddie P, a Houston-based performance poet and workshop facilitator. My work delves into mental health, identity, and resilience—grounded in vulnerability, community, and craft. My poetry has been published in The New York Times and featured on TEDx. I believe in writing that leaves a mark, stings a little, and heals.
